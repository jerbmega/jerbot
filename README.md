# jerbot-neo

jerbot-neo is the **open-source** release of jerbot2, rewritten from scratch so the code is good enough that I feel comfortable open-sourcing it. I wanted to rewrite jerbot2 at some point either way, and figured this would be a good time to do it.

Most functionality from the original bot has been ported over, and only improperly working or non-critical parts of the original have not been implemented.

# New features

Compared to the old bot, jerbot-neo has the following improvements:

* SQLite3 database
* Proper command parsing
* Announcement system
* Global task scheduling
* Proper error handling
