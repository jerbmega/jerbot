# Jerbot Reheated
## Third rewrite's the charm?

*"Let's do it right this time, so I never have to rewrite this bot again.*
- me, writing jerbot2 and jerbot-neo



A *lot* has changed in Discord since I wrote jerbot-neo. There's slash commands, new user interactivity functionality, and more options, intersected with the stagnation of discord.py and the rise of Hikari as a new API with native support for slash commands and the like.

Instead of retrofitting the new interactivity onto the old codebase, causing technical debt, I figured it's best to rewrite the bot (again), especially considering I haven't touched a lot of the code in a *long* time.
